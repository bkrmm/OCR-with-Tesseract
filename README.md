# OCR-with-Tesseract
This project aims to develop a Python-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software that leverages machine learning techniques to accurately recognize and extract text from images. The software will utilize a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to analyze and classify individual characters within an image.
